## üöÄ How to Use on a JioFiber Router

> ‚ö†Ô∏è You must have root access to JioFiber router. Follow guide at https://github.com/JFC-Group/JF-Customisation

### 1. Download the required files

```sh
wget -O /flash2/dropbear --no-check-certificate https://github.com/rabilrbl/dropbear-mipsel/releases/latest/download/dropbear
wget -O /flash2/dropbearkey --no-check-certificate https://github.com/rabilrbl/dropbear-mipsel/releases/latest/download/dropbearkey
chmod +x /flash2/dropbear /flash2/dropbearkey
```

### 2. Generate an SSH key

```sh
/flash2/dropbearkey -t ed25519 -f /flash2/id_dropbear
```

This creates a secure private key at `/flash2/id_dropbear`.

### 3. Start the Dropbear SSH server

```sh
/flash2/dropbear -p 22 -r /flash2/id_dropbear
```

This starts the SSH server on port **22** using your generated key.

### 4. Allow SSH traffic through the firewall

```sh
/pfrm2.0/bin/iptables -I fwInBypass -p tcp --dport 22 -m ifgroup --ifgroup-in 0x1/0x1 -j ACCEPT
```

### 5. Connect to the Router via SSH

From your computer or phone (using an SSH client), run:

```sh
ssh root@<router-ip>
```

> Replace `<router-ip>` with your router‚Äôs actual IP address (e.g., `192.168.1.1`).

When prompted, enter the **root password** of your router to log in.

## üîÅ Auto-Start on Boot in JioFiber routers

To make Dropbear start automatically each time the router reboots:

Add command from step 3 and stpe 4 to file `/flash2/pfrm2.0/etc/customInit` and make that file executable.

This ensures the SSH server and firewall rule are applied every time the device boots.
